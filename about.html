            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dawson Chanlyvong</p>
            <p><strong>Course:</strong> IT 3203 - Web Development</p>
            <p><strong>Semester:</strong> Fall 2025</p>
            <p><strong>University:</strong> Kennesaw State University</p>
            
            <p>I'm Dawson Chanlyvong, I am a junior at KSU and I am majoring in Information Technologies. I am really interested in using my degree to pursue working for a company that caters towards my hobbies. I first found interest in data security and coding because of my dad. He is an IT and I have memories of us attending company events that would bring the fun to working and it really made me realize that working was for not just the money but for the support you provide to a company.</p>
            
            <p>I really enjoy the outdoors, especially rock climbing and camping. Through this course, I have gained hands-on experience with creating structured, semantic HTML, implementing responsive layouts with CSS media queries, and understanding the importance of accessibility and user experience in web design. This project represents my understanding of responsive web design principles and mobile-first development practices.</p>
